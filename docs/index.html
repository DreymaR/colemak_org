    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The QWERTY layout was designed in the 19th century. The Dvorak layout was an attempt to create a better and more ergonomic keyboard layout but it was made before the computer age and some of what we now know about typing efficiently, and it moved nearly all the keys although that wasn't necessary which made it harder to learn. <a href="http://colemak.com"><b>Colemak</b></a> is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.
    </p><p>
        Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak. It comes pre-installed on <a href="https://colemak.com/Mac">Mac</a> and <a href="https://colemak.com/Unix">Linux</a> systems; see below for Windows and others.

    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <div class="quote mt-35">
        <p><i>From the <a href="http://colemak.com">colemak.com</a> main page:</i></p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Ergonomic and comfortable – Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.</li>
            <li>Easy to learn – Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same. Typing lessons available.</li>
            <li>Fast – Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.</li>
            <li>Multilingual – Allows to type in over 40 languages and to type various symbols, e.g. "pâté", "mañana", €, em-dash, non-breaking space.</li>
            <li>Free – Free software released under the public domain. You don't have to buy a new keyboard; just install a program.</li>
        </ul>
    </div><br>

    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <p>
        Colemak isn't just a layout, it's also a creative force in the alt-layout landscape. This site is the community site. On its own, this page is still a bit bare-bones for now, but it acts as a hub for finding other Colemak users and resources of which there are plenty. See the links below.
    </p><p>
        The Colemak community have devised many mods and additions to Colemak, and there are transitional layouts (<a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/tarmak-intro.html"><b>Tarmak</b></a>) if you wish to learn it step by step instead of all at once. DreymaR from the Colemak forums has been working for more than a decade on bringing the word out and making implementations of <a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/"><b>DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks</b></a>; that is, a collection of mods and tricks and knowledge centered around Colemak. If you want to know your options, rummage around in the Big Bag a little! You can select your platform such as Windows, Linux or programmable controllers to learn more about the different implementations. 
    </p><p>
        DreymaR also makes the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL"><b>EPKL program for Windows</b></a> that gives you anything from simple Colemak to pretty much the whole Big Bag experience – and neat help images too. As a Windows user, your main Colemak options are to install a system layout using a MSKLC file like the one found at the main site, running an Autohotkey (AHK) script for simple remapping or using a program like EPKL. EPKL is actually a fancy compiled AHK script that's designed to be more functional and work better at high speeds; it may not be compatible with all games though, so for those you may need an installed layout.

    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Which is better, classical/vanilla Colemak or Colemak-DH?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>It's quite individual really! There are many users of both variants, among them people who have tried both.</li>
                <li>To determine what you like best, decide how you feel about inwards stretches to <kbd>D</kbd> (QWERTY <kbd>G</kbd>) and <kbd>H</kbd>.</li>
                <li>Then compare with the downwards <i>curl</i> to <kbd>V</kbd> and <kbd>M</kbd>. If you prefer those, consider Cmk-DH.</li>
                <li>Individual preference and typing style (e.g., float vs grounding) may affect the choice.</li>
                <li>Both variants are well suited for both row-staggered and matrix/ortho keyboards.</li>
                <li>The speed typists Viper and Sophie have achieved 220+ WPM typing test results on both variants between them.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Is Colemak-DH the same as...?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>There are many names and letters and an older standard floating around, let's hopefully clear this up a bit.</li>
                <li>The DH mod for Colemak is the result of SteveP's Mod-DH project from 2014. As its name says, it moves the D and H keys.</li>
                <li>It's a <i>Curl</i> mod: It lets the home row curl down like the natural curve of fingers on a hand instead of stretching inwards.</li>
                <li>To be precise, 'Mod-DH' is the <i>project</i>. The 'Curl-DH' or just 'DH' <i>mod</i> is the result. 'Colemak-DH' is the resulting <i>layout</i>.</li>
                <li>On a row-staggered board (any standard keyboard has a 1/4–1/2u row stagger), DH is accompanied by an <i>Angle</i> mod.</li>
                <li>The geometrically descriptive name for Colemak-DH on a row-staggered board is therefore <b>Colemak-CurlAngle</b> or Cmk-CA.</li>
                <li>There is only one standard variant of Cmk-DH now, although a few have been tried out. It's the same as the original from 2014.</li>
                <li>Standard Cmk-DH has M on the home row and is thus also named Cmk-DHm. There's also a Cmk-DHk, the former standard (2017–2020).</li>
                <li>A common misconception is that the 'm' in DHm stands for 'matrix' as in matrix/ortho boards. This is wrong. I should know; I made that abbreviation.</li>
                <li>Some use Colemak-CurlAngle plus further Wide and Sym mods, which makes Colemak-CAWS. See the <a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org">Big Bag</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Can I use Colemak-DH without moving the Z key?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <h3>COLEMAK-DH WITHOUT THE ANGLE MOD?!?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, we do get that one a lot from newcomers. Please read the Big Bag Ergo mod page to understand what the Angle mod does: It allows you to keep the left wrist straight like your right wrist has always been. That's important for typing comfort, and so it's baked into the DH mod for row-staggered keyboards.
            </p><p>
                Even though the simplicity of the ISO Angle mod doesn't quite carry over to the ANSI world and the rare <kbd>Z</kbd> has to move into the middle as a result (unless you use an advanced type of Angle mod like FatZ), do keep in mind that this key is indeed rare and the slight hassle of moving it and the Undo shortcut is abundantly warranted in our strong opinion and experience. There is a little discord in the typing community on this subject, but many top typists and layout designers support the idea of the Angle mod wholeheartedly.
            </p><p>
                Colemak-DH was designed for use with an Angle mod on row-stag boards, and we believe that using it without is disregarding its potential. The <kbd>V</kbd> key will be in a too poor position. And your left wrist will still be at an uncomfortable angle, experiencing what's known in medicine as ulnar deviation.
            </p><p>
                If you have a matrix/ortholinear or any similarly advanced ergonomic keyboard there is no Angle mod on it. Hopefully your board is split or angled in such a way that you can type with straight wrists; single-slab/"plank" ortho boards may not do that for you. Anyway, Colemak-DH for ortho boards is just Colemak-Curl.
            </p><p>
                In case you're wondering what to do if you have both kinds of board, many people in this situation have said that using an Angle mod on the row-stag actually feels <i>more</i> like the ortho experience, <kbd>Z</kbd> be damned! That's how cursed the traditional left-hand typing technique is.
            </p>

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Isn't Workman/Norman/Whatever better than Colemak? Its documentation says so!"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>Please don't trust any layout maker's own words blindly. Layout design is a hobby, and yet far from trivial.</li>
                <li>Specifically, the Norman and Workman layout makers seem exceedingly proud of themselves; more so than warranted.</li>
                <li>For one: Both these layouts have too high same-finger bigram (SFB) stats, and their fans often downplay the problem.</li>
                <li>Secondly, many users of these layouts who have studied layout design a little seem unhappy with their choice.</li>
                <li>Workman was created to address Colemak's lateral index finger travel to <kbd>D</kbd> and <kbd>H</kbd> (see DH vs vanilla). It did so poorly.</li>
                <li>If you do dislike lateral travel, Colemak-DH achieves the same thing without sacrificing layout quality.</li>
                <li>Here's Ben Vallack talking about leaving Workman: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVmJrZF9xwk&t=245s" target="_">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVmJrZF9xwk&t=245s</a></li>

    </div>

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"Which layouts <i>are</i> better than Colemak?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>There is a virtually infinite pool of possible keyboard layouts, and no clear way of selecting a winner.</li>
                <li>We know some important factors, of course: Using fast fingers for frequent keys, avoiding bad n-grams etc.</li>
                <li>Even so, at some point we're bound to hit a diminishing returns curve. This was part of Colemak's design philosophy.</li>
                <li>Shai Coleman chose to add some additional design limitations to ease learning, transition and hotkey consistency.</li>
                <li>So, by releasing these extra limitations you could in theory make a slightly more efficient layout at the cost of some benefits.</li>
                <li>More changes from QWERTY, more keys changing hands, and fewer shortcuts kept may not matter to you though? They will to many.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Any answer depends a lot on your modeling and scoring. And individual factors and preferences become important, as with vanilla vs DH.</li>
                <li>Many layouts claiming superiority have more pinky movement than Colemak! Also more pinky SFBs even with fewer total SFBs.</li>
                <li>Colemak places the quite common <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd> on pinkies, but has little pinky movement to the other rows.</li>
                <li>If you're interested in the field of alt-layouts, one good suggestion is to join the Alt Keyboard Layout Discord for discussion and info.</li>
                <li>A word of warning: If you choose a "bleeding-edge" layout, you're pretty much on your own concerning implementation and support.</li>
                <br>
                <li>So in conclusion: If you put in a lot of effort you may be able to find a layout that works better for you than Colemak does?</li>
                <li>Most likely not by a lot though. And it's an uncertain process at best.</li>
                <li>We believe that Colemak is very well optimized within its design parameters, and an excellent and well proven choice of layout.</li>
                <li>One interesting way of going further, is to add mods and other tools. Again, see the <a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org">Big Bag</a></li> for info.</li>

    <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
        <p><span>"I want to tweak Colemak a little to suit my needs!"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>Needs? Or wants, based on just a little experience with it? Keep in mind that you'll likely be using it for a long time, be careful!</li>
                <li>Unless you are an experienced layout designer, consider that you probably don't know and understand enough to do it well.</li>
                <li>On a properly optimized layout it's generally very hard to change even a small thing without breaking something more important.</li>
                <li>You need to understand typing concepts such as grounding vs float, hand and finger balances, alternation vs rolls, lateral stretches etc.</li>
                <li>You need to understand anatomical concepts such as finger strengths, interdependences and speeds, ulnar deviation etc.</li>
                <li>Same-finger bigrams is a crucial factor in layout design! You may not notice them at first though. Even some individually rare bigrams can trip you up in the long run.</li>
                <li>Read the <a href="https://colemak.com/Design_FAQ">Colemak Design FAQ</a> and the accompanying <a href="https://colemak.com/Design">Design overview</a> by Shai Coleman first, to learn more.</li>
                <li>Beyond simple SFBs, among the things to consider are roll direction and redirects, skip-grams and whatnot. Here be dragons!</li>

        <p><span>"My right pinky gets tired! And typing 'you' is uncomfortable! What's wrong?"</span></p>
        <div class="spoilerBody">
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>Many QWERTY typists hardly use their right hand pinky, as the rare semicolon sits in its home row position and some type P with their ring finger.</li>
                <li>These typists may need to build up their finger strength a little to type well on Colemak. Pinky fu! 🥋</li>
                <li>There are layouts that deprioritize the pinkies more than Colemak. These generally aren't so good, however.</li>
                <li>There are even highly optimized layouts that have heavier pinky load than Colemak.</li>
                <li>The <b>YOU</b> trigram in particular, isn't so great on Colemak. Trust us though: Most common n-grams are great.</li>
                <li>This word has a so-called <i>redirect</i> on Colemak, which means that it changes direction (RL then LR). That's not so comfortable.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, it uses both the weak pinky and the codependent ring finger.</li>
                <br>
                <li>TL;DR: Nothing is really wrong. You just have to train it!</li>
