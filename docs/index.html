        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>
            The QWERTY layout was designed in the 19th century. The Dvorak layout was an attempt to create a better and more ergonomic keyboard layout but it was made before the computer age and some of what we now know about typing efficiently, and it moved nearly all the keys although that wasn't necessary which made it harder to learn. <a href="http://colemak.com"><b>Colemak</b></a> is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.
        </p>        <p>
            Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak. It comes pre-installed on <a href="https://colemak.com/Mac">Mac</a> and <a href="https://colemak.com/Unix">Linux</a> systems; see below for Windows and others.
        </p>        <p>
            Colemak isn't just a layout, it's also a creative force in the alt-layout landscape. This site is the community site On its own, this page is bare-bones for now, but it's a hub for finding other Colemak users and resources of which there are plenty. See the links below.
        </p>        <p>
            The Colemak community have devised many mods and additions to Colemak, and there are transitional layouts (<a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/tarmak-intro.html"><b>Tarmak</b></a>) if you wish to learn it step by step instead of all at once. DreymaR from the Colemak forums has been working for more than a decade on bringing the word out and making implementations of what he calls <a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/"><b>DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks</b></a>; that is, a collection of mods and tricks and knowledge centered around Colemak. If you want to know your options, rummage around in the Big Bag a little! You can select your platform such as Windows, Linux or programmable controllers to learn more about the different implementations. 
        </p>        <p>
            DreymaR also makes the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL"><b>EPKL program for Windows</b></a> that gives you anything from simple Colemak to pretty much the whole Big Bag of tricks – and neat help images too. As a Windows user, your main Colemak options are to install a system layout using a MSKLC file like the one found at the main site, running an Autohotkey (AHK) script for simple remapping or using a program like EPKL. EPKL is actually a fancy compiled AHK script that's designed to be more functional and work better at high speeds; it may not be compatible with all games though, so for those you may need a MSKLC installed layout.

            <p>From the <a href="http://colemak.com">colemak.com</a> main page:</p>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
    
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>Ergonomic and comfortable – Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.</li>
                <li>Easy to learn – Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same. Typing lessons available.</li>
                <li>Fast – Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.</li>
                <li>Multilingual – Allows to type in over 40 languages and to type various symbols, e.g. "pâté", "mañana", €, em-dash, non-breaking space.</li>
                <li>Free – Free software released under the public domain. You don't have to buy a new keyboard, just install a program.</li>
            </ul>

            If you, like us, think it's a shame Microsoft hasn't added the Colemak layout to Windows yet when it's found both on Linux and MacOS, there's something we'd like to ask of you. The Colemak Discord creator NottNott has made a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/microsoft-add-colemak-as-a-pre-installed-keyboard-layout-to-windows"><b>Change.org petition to add Colemak as a pre-installed keyboard layout to Microsoft Windows</b></a>. Please take a look … and we hope you'll sign it too of course!
