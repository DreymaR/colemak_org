        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>
            The QWERTY layout was designed in the 19th century. The Dvorak layout was an attempt to create a better and more ergonomic keyboard layout but it was made before the computer age and some of what we now know about typing efficiently, and it moved nearly all the keys although that wasn't necessary which made it harder to learn. <a href="http://colemak.com"><b>Colemak</b></a> is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.
        </p>        <p>
            Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak. It comes pre-installed on <a href="https://colemak.com/Mac">Mac</a> and <a href="https://colemak.com/Unix">Linux</a> systems; see below for Windows and others.

        <p>
            Colemak isn't just a layout, it's also a creative force in the alt-layout landscape. This site is the community site On its own, this page is bare-bones for now, but it's a hub for finding other Colemak users and resources of which there are plenty. See the links below.
        </p>        <p>
            The Colemak community have devised many mods and additions to Colemak, and there are transitional layouts (<a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/tarmak-intro.html"><b>Tarmak</b></a>) if you wish to learn it step by step instead of all at once. DreymaR from the Colemak forums has been working for more than a decade on bringing the word out and making implementations of <a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/"><b>DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks</b></a>; that is, a collection of mods and tricks and knowledge centered around Colemak. If you want to know your options, rummage around in the Big Bag a little! You can select your platform such as Windows, Linux or programmable controllers to learn more about the different implementations. 
        </p>        <p>
            DreymaR also makes the <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL"><b>EPKL program for Windows</b></a> that gives you anything from simple Colemak to pretty much the whole Big Bag experience â€“ and neat help images too. As a Windows user, your main Colemak options are to install a system layout using a MSKLC file like the one found at the main site, running an Autohotkey (AHK) script for simple remapping or using a program like EPKL. EPKL is actually a fancy compiled AHK script that's designed to be more functional and work better at high speeds; it may not be compatible with all games though, so for those you may need an installed layout.

            <p>From the <a href="http://colemak.com">colemak.com</a> main page:</p>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
    
            <ul class="disc">
                <li>Ergonomic and comfortable â€“ Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.</li>
                <li>Easy to learn â€“ Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same. Typing lessons available.</li>
                <li>Fast â€“ Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.</li>
                <li>Multilingual â€“ Allows to type in over 40 languages and to type various symbols, e.g. "pÃ¢tÃ©", "maÃ±ana", â‚¬, em-dash, non-breaking space.</li>
                <li>Free â€“ Free software released under the public domain. You don't have to buy a new keyboard; just install a program.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
            <p><span>"Which is better, classical/vanilla Colemak or Colemak-DH?"</span></p>
            <div class="spoilerBody">
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>It's quite individual really! There are many users of both variants, also people who have tried both.</li>
                    <li>People have achieved 220+ WPM typing test results on both variants (Viper and Sophie).</li>
                    <li>Individual preference and typing style (e.g., float vs grounding) may affect the choice.</li>
                    <li>Neither is particularly suited for row-staggered vs matrix/ortho keyboards, it seems.</li>
                    <li>To determine what you like best, decide how you feel about inwards stretches to D (QWERTY G) and H.</li>
                    <li>Then compare with the downwards <b>curl</b> to V and M. If you strongly prefer those, consider Cmk-DH.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
            <p><span>"Isn't Workman/Norman/Whatever better than Colemak? Its documentation says so!"</span></p>
            <div class="spoilerBody">
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Please don't trust any layout maker's own words blindly. There really are a lot of fairly clueless people, and layout design isn't trivial.</li>
                    <li>Specifically, the Norman and Workman layout makers seem exceedingly proud of themselves and imnsho shouldn't be.</li>
                    <li>For one: Both these layouts have too high same-finger bigram (SFB) stats, and their fans often downplay the problem.</li>
                    <li>Secondly, many users of these layouts who have studied layout design a little seem unhappy with their choice.</li>
                    <li>Workman was created to solve Colemak's lateral index finger travel to <kbd>D</kbd> and <kbd>H</kbd> (see DH vs vanilla). It did so poorly.</li>
                    <li>If you do dislike lateral travel, Colemak-DH achieves the same thing without sacrificing layout quality.</li>
                    <li>Here's Ben Vallack talking about leaving Workman: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVmJrZF9xwk&t=245s" target="_">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVmJrZF9xwk&t=245s</a></li>

            <p><span>"I want to tweak Colemak a little to suit my needs!"</span></p>
            <div class="spoilerBody">
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Unless you really are an experienced layout designer, be open to the fact that you probably don't know and understand enough to do it well.</li>
                    <li>On a properly optimized layout it's generally very hard to change even a small thing without breaking something more important.</li>
                    <li>You should understand some central concepts such as finger strengths, interdependences and speeds, as well as the crucial same-finger bigram.</li>
                    <li>Read the <a href="https://colemak.com/Design_FAQ" target="_">https://colemak.com/Design_FAQ</a> and the accompanying <a href="https://colemak.com/Design" target="_">https://colemak.com/Design</a> first, to learn more.</li>

        <div class="spoiler newbspoiler">
            <p><span>"My right pinky gets tired! And typing <code class="inline">you</code> is uncomfortable! What's wrong?"</span></p>
            <div class="spoilerBody">
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Many QWERTY typists hardly use their right hand pinky, as the rare semicolon sits in its home row position and some type P with their ring finger.</li>
                    <li>These typists may need to build up their finger strength a little to type well on Colemak. Pinky fu! ðŸ¥‹</li>
                    <li>There are layouts that deprioritize the pinkies more than Colemak. These generally aren't so good, however.</li>
                    <li>There are even highly optimized layouts that have heavier pinky load than Colemak.</li>
                    <li>The <code class="inline">you</code> trigram in particular, isn't so great on Colemak. Trust me, most common n-grams are great.
                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li>This one has a so-called <code class="inline">redirect</code>, which means that it changes direction (RL then LR). That's not so comfortable.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, it uses both the weak pinky and the codependent ring finger. You just have to train it!</li>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Depends a lot on modeling and scoring. Individual factors and preferences become important, as with vanilla vs DH.</li>
                    <li>Diminishing returns, infinite layout pool</li>
                    <li>More changes from QWERTY, more keys change hands, fewer shortcuts kept</li>
                    <li>Many layouts claiming superiority have more pinky movement! Also more pinky SFBs even with fewer total SFBs.</li>
                    <li>Colemak places the quite common <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd> on pinkies, but has little pinky movement to the other rows.</li>
                    <li>Word of warning about implementation.</li>

        <p>
            If you, like us, think it's a shame Microsoft hasn't added the Colemak layout to Windows yet when it's found both on Linux and MacOS, there's something we'd like to ask of you. The Colemak Discord creator NottNott has made a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/microsoft-add-colemak-as-a-pre-installed-keyboard-layout-to-windows"><b>Change.org petition to add Colemak as a pre-installed keyboard layout to Microsoft Windows</b></a>. Please take a look â€¦ and we hope you'll sign it too of course!
